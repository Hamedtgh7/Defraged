                <p>My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chase the soccer ball when I pracrice. It is so funny to
                    see her
                    running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. It just won't
                    fit!</p>

    <p>Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that had
        rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha get in front of me and knocked me
        backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy
        that Shasha was smarter than I was!</p>
